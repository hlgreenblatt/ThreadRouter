"""
The shareable FabricPC route table.

WHAT WE SHARE, AND WHY IT IS NOT WEIGHTS
========================================
The obvious way to let two ThreadRouters share what they know is to ship the
FabricPC network's weights. We deliberately do not, for three reasons:

1. They do not fit each other. In tk_router the output layer is
   `N_OUT = len(PATHS) * len(ATTRS)`, and `PATHS` is derived from that agent's
   own ROSTER. An agent with a 3090 on the LAN has paths an agent on a laptop
   has never heard of. Weight tensors from a 9-path net are meaningless to a
   4-path net, and silently wrong if forced.

2. Weights are not inspectable. "Why did you start routing code to GLM?" has no
   answer you can read. Observations answer it directly, which matters for a
   governance story and for debugging a swarm at 2am.

3. Averaging weights across agents that saw different traffic is a known way to
   make every agent slightly worse. Averaging *evidence* is well defined.

So the unit of exchange is an OBSERVATION:

    (fingerprint, path_id, outcome bundle, how many times, when, who saw it)

which reads as: "for requests shaped like this, this path produced this
outcome." The receiver replays it through its own `Router.learn_outcome`, for
the paths it actually has, and ignores the rest. Heterogeneous fleets just work.

THE PRIVACY PROPERTY WE GET FOR FREE
====================================
`tk_router.fingerprint()` already documents itself as "No LLM, no raw text out"
— 8 floats of word shape (has_code_fence, is_question, length_norm, …). An
observation therefore contains no user text, no prompt, no reply. Agents can
pool routing experience across trust boundaries without pooling their users'
data. That was true before ThreadLink existed; it is what makes sharing safe,
and it is the reason this is a route table rather than a transcript.

THE TABLE
=========
Fingerprints are continuous, so raw ones would never repeat and the table would
grow forever. We quantize each fingerprint into a CELL — 6 binary shape flags
plus 2 bucketed continuous features — giving at most 2^6 * 4 * 4 = 1024 rows.
That is the route table: request-shape cell -> per-path expected outcome.
