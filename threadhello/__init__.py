"""ThreadHello — ThreadRouter agents introducing themselves and trading
learned FabricPC route tables, over a ThreadLink comlink.

ThreadRouter answers "where should this work go?". ThreadHello answers "what
routing knowledge can two routers exchange?". ThreadLink answers "how do two
agents talk at all?" — and lives in its own repo, because it is useful to
agents that have never heard of routing.
